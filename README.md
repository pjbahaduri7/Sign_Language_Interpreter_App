### SLI App is an android application that helps out deaf and dumb people to communicate with others using deep learning technics.

### If you want to test out the app here is the apk of it: [SLI APP](https://github.com/prajwalmani/Sign_Language_Interpreter_App/blob/master/SLI%20APP.apk) (Hopefully soon we will be launching it on google play store!.)

### And if you want to see just the demo of the app then there is the [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTd5xGtzOcM) for it. I would highly suggest to download the apk and try out.

### Thank you for checking out the repo!. If you like the project then star the repo and lets us know that you appreciate our work!
